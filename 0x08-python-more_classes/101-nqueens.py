"""
Solves the N-queens puzzle.
Checks all possible soln to placing N non-attacking queens on chessboard.

Example:
    $ ./nqueens.py N

N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A list containing solutions.
        Solutions are r in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
        where `r` and `c` represent the row and column, respectively,
        where a queen must be placed on the chessboard.
